dance_layers is a simple python 2 / 3 program to suggest combinations of three dance elements to try layering on each other


TO RUN AS AN APP
- To run this dev server, run the following command from the DanceLayers/DanceLayers folder
    FLASK_APP=dance_layers_app.py flask run
- visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see suggested move


TO RUN AT COMMAND LINE
- Run as "python dance_layers.py <file_name>"" where file_name is a json file stored in the same folder of the format 
{
    "body part 1": [
        "move 1",
        "move 2",
        "move 3"
    ],
    "body part 2" ...
}
- An example json file of blues movements is included here, with details inspired by the wonderful Julie Brown's solo class at Spoonful 2016
- Default setting will always start with the feet (and assumes a 'feet' element in the json). Changing this will require a change to the constant within the code
- The sample file will likely produce some very weird and/or difficult combinations, this is by design


TO DO
- Make switching off 'START_WITH_FEET' easier
